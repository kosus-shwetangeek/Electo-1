In Unix environment with Mono, this can be a fully qualified path to a MySQL socket file. With this configuration, the Unix socket is used instead of the TCP/IP socket. Currently, only a single socket name can be given, so accessing MySQL in a replicated environment using Unix sockets is not currently supported.

Compression is used if both client and server support ZLIB compression, and the client has requested compression using this option. A compressed packet header is: packet length (3 bytes), packet number (1 byte), and Uncompressed Packet Length (3 bytes). The Uncompressed Packet Length is the number of bytes in the original, uncompressed packet. If this is zero, the data in this packet has not been compressed. When the compression protocol is in use, either the client or the server may compress packets. However, compression will not occur if the compressed length is greater than the original length. Thus, some packets will contain compressed data while other packets will not.
